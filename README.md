**Animal Kingdom Classfication**

The javaScript code have successfully applied and implemented the four pillars of OOP 
To successfully classify animals based on Parent and ChildClass.

*Polymorphim*
This was strictly applied to the attributes and methods (movement and skin) in the animal class
The subclasses posses unique properties of the same character

*Abstraction*
This was applied and implemented on the baseClass (Animal)
This was done to help prevent the Animal class from implementing its own properties
But allowing other subclasses to inherit from the abstracted class

*Inheritance*
This was applied and implemented to the subclasses which were extended to Animal classes
This allows the childClass (Aves, Mammals, etc) to inherit properties of its parents class

*Encpasulation*
This was carried out on the Animal class properties (body temp, backbone, etc)
This makes the class proprties private, while only accessible and can be implemented only by the childClasses
